- text: "the project of getting InfraShield onto higher throughput via ai-assisted development using agents is due for a presentation, but the method of how to focus the ideas has not been fleshed out. I'm not sure if the demo should be about using agents for development or that should be focused on security. I guess I really just want to see where they're at as a team. So I guess that's the question: are we talking about demonstrating high throughput and the security or are we talking about what they're able to do with the agents or are we talking about a rules-based generator where we want the rules to be better than Quickbooks rules. To make a set of rules to create rules but that would suggest new rules to the users based on learned activities and behaviors 7/6/2025 03:39 PM work"
